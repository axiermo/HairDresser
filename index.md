### About The Game



In Hair Dresser you will have to manage your own succesful hair dresser!

The game is divided in two cycles where the NPCs will act different in each of the unique game areas.
The player will have to decide where does he want to invest his/her money in order to success. He can decide to buy more cleaning seats, more cutting seats adn/or hire more hairdressers and repairmans.

But those won't be the only expenses he will see, money will be deducted all the time in order to pay for the water and the light of the Hair Dresser.
